         <h2> ALUMNI ASSOCIATION</h2>
         <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> An Alumni association is an association of graduates or, more broadly, of former students alumni alumni of universities colleges schools independent schools, fraternities, and sororities  often form groups with alumni from the same organization. These associations often organize social events, publish newsletters or magazines, and raise funds for the organization. Many provide a variety of benefits and services that help alumni maintain connections to their educational institution and fellow graduates. In the US, most associations do not require its members to be an alumnus of a university to enjoy membership and privileges.
            Additionally, such groups often support new alumni, and provide a forum to form new friendships and business relationships with people of similar background.
            Alumni associations are mainly organized around universities or departments of universities, but may also be organized among students that studied in a certain country. In the past, they were often considered to be the universities or school's old boy society (or old boysâ€™ network). Today, alumni associations involve graduates of all age groups and demographics.
            An Alumni association was formed in the College during Academic year 2025-26 consisting of Alumni of both Engineering and M.B.A Students.
            The Association serves the requirements of Alumni and attends to the problems of Alumni, carrying out a variety of activities. It strengthens ties between alumni as well as between alumni and Alma matter, providing opportunities for cooperation and communication at present.
            In addition to the Alumni association an Alumni committee is also functioning in the college with the following as the office bearers. The Alumni committee conducts meetings once in every three months to discuss various issues related to Alumni.</p>
